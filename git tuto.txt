git init

Sometimes, when you make small changes, using the staging environment seems like a waste of time. It is possible to commit changes directly, skipping the staging environment. The -a option will automatically stage every changed, already tracked file.
git commit -a -m "New line added"
To view the history of commits for a repository, you can use the log command:

Create, and move to a new branch with the name hello-you:


git checkout -b hello-you
